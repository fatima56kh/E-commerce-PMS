# E-commerce-Project Management System
# E-Commerce - Project Management with JIRA and GitHub

# Project Overview
This project involves creating an E-Commerce application with integrated JIRA for project management and GitHub for version control. I actively managed project tasks, sprints, and timelines in JIRA while collaborating through GitHub for code development and versioning.

# Tools & Technologies
JIRA: Project management, task tracking, backlog management, and sprint planning.
GitHub: Version control, code repository, pull requests, and commit tracking.

# Key Contributions & Features

**Managed Tasks with JIRA**: Created and organized boards (Kanban/Scrum) for task tracking, designed and prioritized backlogs, and ensured deadlines were met using timelines.
**Integrated GitHub with JIRA**: Linked GitHub commits and pull requests to JIRA issues for seamless tracking and collaboration.
**Form Design in JIRA**: Created custom issue forms for task categorization and data collection.
**Agile Methodology**: Actively used Scrum/Kanban boards for sprint planning and task management.
**Collaboration & Workflow**: Streamlined communication by using JIRA’s roadmap to manage project milestones and GitHub’s version control for code updates.
   
# How I Benefited from JIRA
**Efficient Task Management**: Organized tasks with clear priorities, ensuring timely delivery.
**Agile Methodology**: Implemented Scrum and Kanban boards for better sprint planning and flexibility.
**Enhanced Collaboration**: Streamlined communication with team members using shared boards and progress tracking.
**Visual Project Tracking**: Used dashboards to monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and optimize workflows.
**Integration with GitHub**: Linked commits and pull requests to JIRA issues for seamless task and code tracking.

# Scrum Board
1. Visual tool for tracking task progress (To Do, In Progress, Done).
2. Increases transparency, prioritizes tasks, and improves workflow efficiency by helping teams identify bottlenecks and stay aligned on goals.

# Backlog
1. A prioritized list of tasks and issues to be worked on. 
2. Helps organize work, prioritize tasks, and ensures important tasks are addressed in future sprints, keeping the project on track.
